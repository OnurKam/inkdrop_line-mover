# Line Mover
Quickly move your selection or the current line up/down via shorcuts.

Inspired by popular IDEs where moving lines up or down makes the life easier.


### Installation
```
ipm install line-mover
```

### Move your selection/current line
Once the lines selected (if no selection, the current line will be moved), press `Alt/Option` + `Up/Down` arrow.
